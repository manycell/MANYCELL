MANYCELL software is organised into three packages in addition to CopasiWS software for simulation of sub-cellular network model.

Package 1 - manycell-core:
This package is the main simulation engine. It receives requests from the manycell-mas package and carries out simulation of the single cell model using serial, parallel or ISAT based simulations.

Package 2 - manycell-mas:
This is a multi-agents simulator. Developed in Java but uses JNI to connect and send request to the manycell-core. 
It takes the multiscale model encoded in Multiscale Model XML description language (MMXML) as input and automatically generates an executable code for simulation of the multiscale model.

Package 3 - manycell-web:
This package provides the web-based interface to MANYCELL. It is developed in Java and JSP using struts. It runs on apache/tomcat server. 

CopasiWS - COPASI Web Services:
This is an independent software needed by MANYCELL for simulation of biochemical reaction network encoded in SBML.
