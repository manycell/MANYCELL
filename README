MANYCELL software is organised into three packages. 
Package 1 - manycell-core:
This package is the main simulation engine. It receives requests from the manycell-mas package and carries out simulation of the single cell model
using serial, parallel or ISAT based simulations.

Package 2 - manycell-mas:
This is a multi-agents simulator. Developed in Java but uses JNI to connect and send request to the manycell-core.

Package 3 - manycell-web:
This package provides the web-based interface to MANYCELL. It is developed Java and JSP using struts. It runs on apache/tomcat server.
