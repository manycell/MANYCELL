<div id="section_header">What is ManyCell?</div>
 <p>
ManyCell is a flexible and efficient multiscale agent-based modelling and simulation environment for cellular systems. It
uses ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model the internal biochemistry 
of cells; each cell is modelled as an agent, where its state changes depend on discrete 
events that are triggered by the ODEs. It allows other entities, such as
the extracellular medium or other extrinsic factors, to be modelled as agents.
 
ManyCell is designed as a component-based system with each component having a 
well-defined interface for interacting with other components. It aims to combine available multiscale methods
that have been tested in other scientific disciplines with distributed computing and relational 
database technologies to simulate large-scale multiscale cellular systems.
By leveraging potentially useful computationally efficient numerical methods and powerful 
distributed computing, we hope to be able to comprehensively and efficiently simulate
multiscale models of many large-scale cellular systems.

<div id="section_header">How does ManyCell work?</div>
<p>
ManyCell takes multiscale model defined in XML format (MMXML) as input and automatically generates executable code for the 
multiscale model specified in the MMXML input file. The type of executable code generated depends on the choice of
the user. All models at different levels of biological organisation of the system being modelled must be specified in the MMXML file. 
ManyCell presently supports the definition of sub-cellular, cellular and micro-environment model information of biological systems. 

<div id="section_header">What Output do you get from ManyCell?</div>
<p>
ManyCell stores all data generated during the simulation for cellular events and states of the sub-cellular species including final 
output data in RDBMS. This allows the number of transactions (events triggered by the underlying
ODEs) to be extremely large, and as a bonus the simulation results are easily managed and queried. 
Data generated are analysed automatically and presented graphically at the end of simulation.
